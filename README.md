# Arcade Game Clone Frogger

## Description
In this game you have a Player, Enemies (Bugs) and Collectibles (Gems, Hearts). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Collectibles are randomly placed on the paved block portion. Picking up Gems grants +200 points and picking up Hearts + 1 life. If a player collides with an enemy, the player loses one of his lives and he's moved back to the start square. Once the player runs out of lives the game is lost. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
